# Wheelchair-Project

This project was a case study for my DataCamp certification.

Description of the probject:

### Company Background
National Accessibility currently installs wheelchair ramps for office buildings and schools.
The marketing manager wants the company to start installing ramps for event venues as well. 
According to a new survey, approximately 40% of event venues are not wheelchair accessible. 
However, it is not easy to know whether a venue already has a ramp installed.
It is a waste of time to contact venues that already have a ramp installed, and it also looks bad for the company. 
They would like the help of the data science team in predicting which venues already have a ramp installed. 

### Customer Question
The marketing manager would like to know:
- Can you develop a model to predict whether an event venue already has a wheelchair ramp installed?

### Success Criteria
To reduce the amount of time wasted by the company contacting venues that already have a ramp, 
at least two-thirds of venues predicted to be without a ramp should not have a ramp.
